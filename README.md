> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's very important to outline that the amount of material provided by the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Banja Luka allowed for public sharing and distribution is very limited and content of this repository meets all the limits. Any confidential piece of material from lectures or other on-campus activities which the aforementioned limitations may or may not disallow for sharing has been removed prior to creation of the repository. For additional protection, the source of every problem (except the ones from labs) has been intentionally left as unknown or ambiguous, whether it comes directly from the Faculty, various internet sources or has been made up on the spot. The number of problems in this repository that have been found all across Internet exceeds 50% which for the most part is the entire point - mastering college-level material on your own.
